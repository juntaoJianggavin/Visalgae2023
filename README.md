Microalgae, vital for ecological balance and economic sectors, present challenges in detection due to their diverse sizes and conditions. This paper summarizes the second "Vision Meets Algae" (VisAlgae) Challenge, aiming to enhance high-throughput microalgae cell detection. The challenge dataset includes 1000 images across six classes, featuring microalgae of varying sizes and distinct features. Participants faced tasks such as detecting small targets, handling motion blur, and complex backgrounds. The top 10 methods, outlined here, offer insights into overcoming these challenges and maximizing detection accuracy. This intersection of algae research and computer vision offers promise for ecological understanding and technological advancement.
